# ML-model in C
Adaptive Hierarchical Classification Model with Dynamic Ranging.


This is going to be quite an intensive project, as I am working solo.
So I wouldn't try to hurry it up. Till now the template is ready and have updated the PDF
mentioning the conditions where the model has to learn some anomalies. 

This currently supports training and testing on single inputs, it is a multiple output classifier model.

# Update:
---------
- Added support for higher dimensions. I've developed the idea for 3D classification 
but it can be scaled to further higher dimensions just by adding in more feature inputs and using similar logic.
- Added the PDF of the idea.
- Further implementation will be done in Python or it will get more complex and will be more prone to errors.
- Currently writing the code for the idea. Will be up in some time.
  
Example usage:

Get yourself a dataset.csv with io pairs.
and place it in dataset/dataset.csv.

Go into the model dir,
run ./model.exe

Test on different inputs.
Thank You.
